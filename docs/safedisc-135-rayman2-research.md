# Rayman 2 retail CD — SafeDisc 1.35 research

Status: **read-only classification implemented; native unwrapping not implemented.**

The user reports that [Redump disc 47594](https://redump.org/disc/47594/)
identifies the disc as SafeDisc **1.35.000**. Independently, a
[Wine bug report from 24 December 2009](https://list.winehq.org/hyperkitty/list/wine-bugs%40list.winehq.org/thread/PBMSSMOUG42FC3AE5YDT7WPIEDJIBKC5/)
is titled **"SafeDisc v1.35.000 and Rayman 2"**, corroborating that
this protection version was used for *a* Rayman 2 PC edition. That
does **not** authenticate the exact protected files supplied here.
The tool does not infer a SafeDisc version from a filename, file
size or entropy.

## Owner-supplied inputs, identified by SHA-256 only

| Role | Original name | Size (bytes) | SHA-256 |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Loader | Rayman2.exe | 676,352 | `7927a106ac4f2244e304e57c196170f6cfb311af87ddf59eb6e6c48b9bb0d5e3` |
| Protected data | RAYMAN2.ICD | 683,565 | `4daeae51ded23687fccecd5046dd366b1c083d4931af0a381a0ad0b64bd3d1a6` |
| Companion | dplayerx.dll | 165,888 | `0d5160b1b123636e03a09ae00714f0ff66bbdd759a3f2b639734ecaa487018ee` |

The second uploaded set was byte-identical to the first set. No game
binary, ICD, DLL or decoded output is committed to this repository.

## Read-only inspection

```sh
cargo run --bin unsafedisc-linux -- inspect --generic-inspect \
  --loader Rayman2.exe --icd RAYMAN2.ICD --dplayerx dplayerx.dll \
  --layout --sections
```

Expected properties from the sample (not exhaustive):

- The loader has a valid PE32 x86 header, entry RVA `0x0005FCC0`,
  and three sections.
- The ICD and companion DLL lack an `MZ` prefix and therefore are
  **opaque on-disk input**, not valid PE32 files at offset zero.
- The ICD and DLL have measured Shannon entropies of approximately
  **7.9539** and **7.9525 bits/byte**. High entropy is *not proof* of
  encryption, compression, SafeDisc identity or decryptability.
- A successful generic inspection is a metadata report only. It cannot
  create an EXE or validate gameplay.

The original `inspect --generic-inspect` stopped on these inputs with
`not an MZ executable`. This branch handles opaque files as research
inputs while preserving the existing exact-hash restrictions and
fail-closed behavior in `unwrap` and strict `inspect`.

## Independent static profile of these inputs (2026-11-12)

The following observations were obtained on the original user-supplied files
without loading or executing them (Python standard library, `file`,
`objdump -x`, `objdump -d`).

| Property | `Rayman2.exe` |
|---|---|
| DOS/NT headers | `MZ` at file offset `0x0`; `PE\\0\\0` at `0xB8` |
| PE machine / format | i386 / PE32, GUI |
| Image base | `0x00400000` |
| Entry-point RVA | `0x0005FCC0` |
| Reported PE timestamp | 1999-10-15 23:19:39 UTC (header value; not provenance proof) |
| Sections | `.text`, `.rdata`, `.data` |
| Import DLLs | `USER32.dll`, `GDI32.dll`, `WINMM.dll`, `MSVCRT.dll`, `KERNEL32.dll`, `SHELL32.dll`, `DINPUT.dll` |
| Export directory | Claims `MainWinf.exe`, 110 exported ordinals |
| `CRPE\\0\\0` signature | Not found in this loader |
| `DPLAYERX` plaintext string | Not found in this loader |

The `CRPE` marker used in the *separate* Crimson Skies SafeDisc 1.50.20
research is therefore **not portable as an assumed key-lookup location**.
No hard-coded replacement offset should be invented for 1.35.

The `MZ` and `PE\\0\\0` byte patterns also appear inside the executable
`.text` as x86 instruction operands in code which appears to validate
mapped PE headers and inspect `KERNEL32`. These matches are **not**
additional embedded PE images. This routine is a candidate for further
static cross-reference analysis, not proof of a particular SafeDisc stage.

Measured per-file whole-byte Shannon entropy:

| File | Entropy (bits/byte) | First 16 bytes |
|---|---:|---|
| `Rayman2.exe` | 6.627897 | `4D 5A 90 00 03 00 00 00 04 00 00 00 FF FF 00 00` |
| `RAYMAN2.ICD` | 7.953942 | `5B 8A C0 E4 6E BF 24 2F 01 6C CE B5 6A 5A B0 3A` |
| `dplayerx.dll` | 7.952524 | `EC FB 30 00 46 7C B8 0A 0D CC 7E 5C 7E 65 90 5F` |

For equal-length 4 KiB blocks (discarding the final incomplete block),
the entropy profiles are:

| Opaque file | Full 4 KiB blocks | Min. block entropy | Max. block entropy |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `RAYMAN2.ICD` | 166 | 7.893266 | 7.927141 |
| `dplayerx.dll` | 40 | 7.894593 | 7.917976 |

No low-entropy 4 KiB region stands out in either file. This does
**not** distinguish encryption from compression or establish cipher
boundaries. The new `--generic-inspect --layout` report prints this
profile for any sufficiently large input.

The ICD is `0xA6E2D` bytes long (not a round PE alignment size),
and the opaque DLL is `0x28800` bytes long. Neither begins with `MZ`
or contains a `PE\\0\\0` signature. A plain `dplayerx.dll` import
is **not present in the static import table** of the loader; this
does not rule out dynamic loading.

**Important:** `Rayman2.exe` has an extensive, genuine PE code,
import and export structure; describing it as “only an encrypted stub”
would go beyond these findings. Its actual protected launch sequence
must be traced before planning a decoder.

### Candidate protected-loader cross-reference (unconfirmed)

At image VA `0x00447C0C`, the executable compares an in-memory DOS
signature to `0x5A4D` (`MZ`), and at `0x00447C18` compares the PE
signature to `0x00004550` (`PE\\0\\0`). It then tests bytes
matching `KERNEL32.DLL` (case folding). At `0x00447D47`, a nearby
routine reads `FS:[0x30]` (Windows process environment block).
These locations are **research leads only**, and may belong to game
runtime code rather than SafeDisc. No key or protected payload boundary
is derived from them.

### Reproducibility

On a system with GNU binutils:

```sh
sha256sum Rayman2.exe RAYMAN2.ICD dplayerx.dll
file Rayman2.exe RAYMAN2.ICD dplayerx.dll
objdump -x Rayman2.exe
objdump -d -M intel --start-address=0x447BE0 --stop-address=0x447E20 Rayman2.exe
```

`objdump` emits the executable's image-base addresses rather than
raw file offsets. The `--start-address` range above is for preliminary
static code inspection, not an exploit or validated key schedule.

## Additional validation: accidental signatures are not PE files

A bounded read-only scan was performed on each owner-supplied input. Every
`MZ` sequence was checked as a possible start of a **structurally valid
x86 PE32** with a DOS header pointer, PE signature, bounded optional header
and section table. Merely counting `MZ` in high-entropy bytes is misleading.

| File | `MZ` occurrences anywhere | Structurally valid PE32 candidates | Candidate offsets |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `Rayman2.exe` | 2 | 1 | `0x0` |
| `RAYMAN2.ICD` | 16 | 0 | none |
| `dplayerx.dll` | 4 | 0 | none |

The extra `MZ` match in the EXE occurs within executable instructions, not
a second embedded image. None of the 20 `MZ` matches in the opaque inputs
passes PE32 structural checks. This is **not** evidence that decrypted PE
code is absent; the expected protected ICD is not meant to be a plain PE.

The generic Rust inspector now displays these two distinct counts with
`--layout`. It also **rejects a corrupt/non-PE loader** instead of silently
calling it an opaque successful inspection; only ICD and companion DLL
inputs are allowed to lack a PE header. These are read-only diagnostics
with synthetic tests; compilation and execution of the new Rust code
remain pending.

## Historical variant clue from original SafeDisc documentation

[CD Media World, *SafeDisc protection/version reference*]
(https://www.cdmediaworld.com/hardware/cdrom/cd_protections_safedisc.shtml)
catalogues a **165,888-byte `DPLAYERX.DLL`** as an early **r2**
family and **138,752 bytes** as a later **r4** family. Our Rayman 2
sample is 165,888 bytes while the previously validated Crimson Skies
sample is 138,752 bytes. This suggests **different protection families**
and a reason not to reuse the Crimson-specific loader/DLL assumptions.

This is a historical third-party classification based on **DLL size**,
not authenticated version metadata: it does **not** independently verify
SafeDisc `1.35.000` or prove that all files of equal size share a
decryption algorithm. The observed file size should be stored as
descriptive data, **not** used as an authorization to decrypt.

In particular, the Rayman 2 EXE contains a normal PE32 import table,
a `MainWinf.exe` export-name field with 110 exported ordinals, and
game-related strings (including `Please insert the CD`). Its entry
RVA `0x5FCC0` begins with what looks like C runtime initialization
rather than an obviously isolated SafeDisc entry stub. This is
important counterevidence against treating the entire EXE as a
recognizable dedicated SafeDisc loader without further trace analysis.
The relationship between this PE and the encrypted ICD is **not yet
established**.

## Independent reproducible research probe (Python 3)

The repository includes `scripts/safedisc_v1_probe.py`. It is a separate
**read-only, standard-library-only** verifier of the PE32/magic/entropy
observations, not a decryptor or SafeDisc recognizer. It requires the
user's own files; none are bundled:

```sh
python scripts/safedisc_v1_probe.py \
  --loader Rayman2.exe \
  --icd RAYMAN2.ICD \
  --dplayerx dplayerx.dll
python -m unittest discover -s scripts -p 'test_safedisc_v1_probe.py'
```

The first command prints machine-readable JSON to standard output;
it does not write any output file. It records explicit
`decryption_attempted: false` and `safedisc_version_asserted: false`
rather than suggesting a successful unwrap.

**Offline validation:** all seven synthetic Python unit tests passed
locally, and the standalone probe was executed against the original
user-supplied Rayman 2 files with the expected three SHA-256 signatures,
2/16/4 total `MZ` occurrences and 1/0/0 structurally valid PE
candidates. The pre-change Rust binary was also run against those files:
it reached the ICD and failed with `ERROR: not an MZ executable`, as
expected. The **new** Rust implementation has *not* been compiled or
executed yet because no Rust compiler is available in the working
container, and GitHub Actions billing is exhausted.

## Read-only IAT cross-reference map (2026-11-12)

A second standard-library-only tool, `scripts/pe_import_xrefs.py`, parses
the original **loader EXE's** bounded x86 PE32 import directory and looks
for the byte-level x86 opcode patterns `FF 15 <IAT VA>` (indirect
`CALL`) and `FF 25 <IAT VA>` (indirect `JMP`) in executable sections.
It does **not** execute any input, attempt decryption, or claim the
patterns are reachable instructions. Seven additional **synthetic**
unit tests validate PE header and import-bound checks.

Results on the owner's SHA-256-verified `Rayman2.exe`:

- **163 imported API entries** across **7 DLLs**:
  `DINPUT.dll`, `GDI32.dll`, `KERNEL32.dll`, `MSVCRT.dll`,
  `SHELL32.dll`, `USER32.dll`, `WINMM.dll`.
- **424 direct IAT CALL/JMP byte-pattern candidates**, across
  **154 import targets**. These are candidate static references, not a
  full executable call graph.

| Imported Win32 function | IAT VA | Candidate direct-call VAs |
|---|---|---|
| `CreateFileA` | `0x0049C058` | `0x00450C16`, `0x0045486F` |
| `ReadFile` | `0x0049C04C` | `0x0044CFB7`, `0x0044D5F7`, `0x0044F897`, `0x004510AE`, `0x004512DA`, `0x0045497F` |
| `GetFileSize` | `0x0049C040` | `0x00454847` |
| `LoadLibraryA` | `0x0049C084` | `0x00421889`, `0x0045894F`, `0x00458B1E`, `0x004590EE`, `0x00459323` |
| `GetProcAddress` | `0x0049C088` | `0x00455D29`, `0x00458A02` |

```sh
python scripts/pe_import_xrefs.py Rayman2.exe > import-xrefs.json
python -m unittest discover -s scripts -p 'test_pe_import_xrefs.py'
```

**Follow-up candidates:** `CreateFileA` appears at `0x450C16`
in a routine which also contains indirect calls through computed
function pointers and writes pseudorandom-looking bytes into a buffer;
another direct file-open pattern occurs at `0x45486F`. At
`0x44EC50` and `0x44F18C`, code references a
`CDROM not found!` string (VA `0x4A2270`) near file-open
handling. These routines must be traced using valid instruction boundaries
before claiming they implement CD checking or a SafeDisc stage.
The executable entry VA `0x45FCC0` begins with an ordinary-looking
SEH/C-runtime prologue; neither this nor file I/O proves that this
EXE is only a protected stub. A full call graph and ICD decoding
remain **unsolved**.

## Historical unSafeDisc 1.5.5 branch condition: important new lead

Existing primary research in
[`docs/unsafedisc-linux.md`](unsafedisc-linux.md)
records disassembly of the user's original historical 20,480-byte
`unSafedisc.exe`, rather than guessing from the separate 18,944-byte
modified public release.

At `0x401F43..0x401F62`, the historical implementation performs an
**extra pre-TEA processing step if the supplied `dplayerx.dll` is
exactly `0x21E00` bytes (138,752)**. This applies to the Crimson Skies
reference, but **not** to the Rayman 2 DLL of `0x28800` bytes
(165,888). The implementation also has a generic 32-round TEA-like
decryption stage at `0x401A55`, subject to other prerequisites.

This is a **specific branch condition in a particular historical tool**,
not an attestation that Rayman 2's ICD follows the same TEA geometry,
that the needed key is known, or that running the old tool would work.
The visible Rayman ICD does not have a PE header, so header restoration
and correct loader/DLL key derivation must be established first.
Do not substitute the Crimson Skies F1/F2 modifier or its fixed keys.

Research priority: reconstruct the **early-family loader -> DLL ->
ICD** data path and its header-handling stage, using read-only static
evidence. The branch above suggests that a universal 1.x implementation
should **identify its applicable algorithmic path**, not merely
rename hard-coded Crimson Skies constants.

## Strong four-byte lane constraint (2026-11-12)

An independent whole-file scan of the owner's exact SHA-256-verified Rayman 2
inputs discovered a previously unrecognized **bit-level invariant**. Using
nonoverlapping groups of four bytes from file offset zero:

| Input | Complete groups | High-bit=1 counts, lanes 0/1/2/3 | Leftover bytes |
|---|---:|---|---:|
| \`Rayman2.exe\` | 169,088 | 73,986 / 74,194 / 71,483 / 71,432 | 0 |
| \`RAYMAN2.ICD\` | **170,891** | **0** / 85,432 / 85,193 / 85,523 | **1** |
| \`dplayerx.dll\` | **41,472** | 20,636 / 20,735 / 20,654 / **0** | 0 |

Every single ICD byte at offsets \`0, 4, 8, ...\` is below \`0x80\`;
the other three lanes use all eight bits. Every single companion DLL
byte at offsets \`3, 7, 11, ...\` is below \`0x80\`; its other lanes
use all eight bits. The lone last byte of the ICD is \`0x29\` and is
excluded from complete-word statistics.

Interpreting those four-byte groups as integer words yields **31-bit,
nonnegative values** when ICD words are read as big-endian and when DLL
words are read as little-endian. The byte-order interpretation is a
**hypothesis about representation, not confirmed original byte order or
cipher mechanics**. In particular, the file sizes differ and this does
not establish a common encoding between the ICD and DLL, nor show how
the game executable could be reconstructed.

This exact high-bit restriction is much stronger evidence of **structured
encoded data** than whole-file Shannon entropy, and it would be
extremely unlikely for uniformly random independent bytes. It does not
prove encryption; compression, 31-bit pseudo-random values or a custom
container can also produce such a restriction.

Simple negative checks:

- The full-word values are not explained by one constant affine
  recurrence \`next = a * current + c mod 2^31\` (a candidate derived
  from early values fails on subsequent words in both files).
- There are only **three matching 31-bit integer values** across the
  two files, close to the approximately **3.3** random collisions
  expected from their stream lengths under independent uniform values;
  this is **not** evidence of a shared keystream.

**Reproduce without executing a protected binary:**

\`\`\`sh
python scripts/safedisc_v1_probe.py \
  --loader Rayman2.exe --icd RAYMAN2.ICD --dplayerx dplayerx.dll
python -m unittest discover -s scripts -p 'test_safedisc_v1_probe.py'
\`\`\`

The JSON \`four_byte_lanes\` member reports the group count, ignored
tail, per-lane high-bit counts, and a cautious representation hint.
The Rust \`inspect --generic-inspect --layout\` report now contains
the corresponding read-only high-bit counts. Synthetic tests cover
opposite byte orders, lone high-bit bit-flips and partial tails.
The new Rust code still requires compilation validation; no protected
file is distributed.

**Next decoding research:** determine how the 31-bit restrictions arise
from the historic SafeDisc 1.x loader and DLL processing stages. Do not
discard the bit or blindly reinterpret words as compressed PE code.

## Historical algorithm boundary: SafeDisc 1.30 to 1.50

A contemporary June 2001 technical study,
[*An overview of SafeDisc versions* by ArthaXerXès]
(https://gbppr.net/cracking/krobar/other/com26.html), reports the following
implementation changes:

- **1.30.0**: import RVAs are XOR-encoded using one 32-bit TEA key word;
  the original 128-bit TEA key still consists of **four identical words**.
  The described loader search targets a literal \`00 00 00 00\` DWORD
  followed by \`A, A, B, B\` DWORD pairs.
- **1.40.4**: an additional callsite repair stage changes selected
  x86 \`FF 15\` references using version-specific arithmetic.
- **1.45.11**: repeated-key weakness was eliminated; per-title
  DPLAYERX EAX modification appeared.
- **1.50.20**: added a separate pre-decryption layer involving DPLAYERX
  routines, which is the extra stage already investigated for Crimson Skies.

**If the owner's Rayman 2 version is indeed 1.35.000**, it lies
between the first two changes, suggesting an early repeated-key TEA
path *may* apply. This exact-version link is **not verified directly**
from the opaque ICD and therefore cannot yet enable any decoder.

A read-only search for the **literal contiguous**
\`0, A, A, B, B\` 32-bit sequence (with nonzero, distinct A and B)
in the user's **676,352-byte Rayman2.exe**, across all four byte
alignments, returned **zero candidates**. Neither \`DECRPE\\0\\0\`
nor \`CRPE\\0\\0\` occurs in that executable. These negative
findings invalidate a naive re-use of the historical loader-pattern
heuristic on this input; they do not disprove TEA, an alternate key
location or the user's SafeDisc version claim.

Further work must first validate the file-pair relationship and
reconstruct a trustworthy PE/header stage before inferring an import
table or deriving a TEA key. No game binary, DLL, decrypted output
or proprietary component is copied into the repository.

## Critical input provenance / structural consistency gate

Before attempting to decode the ICD, verify whether the three uploaded files
come from the **same original installation stage** and whether they are the
actual protected components, rather than CD-resident placeholders, scrambled
data or incorrectly extracted files.

A [contemporary SafeDisc 1 write-up by a Wine developer (April 2002)]
(https://www.winehq.org/pipermail/wine-devel/2002-April/005861.html)
documents a wrapper with `.text`, `.txt` and `.txt2` sections, which
creates the ICD as a suspended Windows process, then loads
`dplayerx.dll` to decode it. This architecture normally requires a
loadable PE header on those executable images at the point they are
passed to the Windows loader.

Our exact owner-supplied files show a **structural discrepancy**:

| Component | Actual format | Why this matters |
|---|---|---|
| `Rayman2.exe` | x86 PE32 with `.text`, `.rdata`, `.data` | Does not have the exact `.txt/.txt2` section layout described for one historic SafeDisc 1 variant; not proof it is wrong |
| `RAYMAN2.ICD` | no `MZ` or valid PE32 header at offset zero | Cannot be launched directly as a Windows process in its present on-disk form |
| `dplayerx.dll` | no `MZ` or valid PE32 header at offset zero | Cannot be loaded directly by ordinary Windows `LoadLibrary` in its present form |

These discrepancies **do not prove corruption**: version-specific
preprocessing, an unusual CD layout, or a different install-time
representation are possible. The last two files are also systematically
constrained to 31-bit words, unlike normal PE files. The evidence
does justify suspending speculative TEA-key search until provenance
is established.

The stand-alone Python probe now writes a `structural_consistency`
diagnostic with `corruption_asserted: false`, including separate
`no_pe32_at_file_start` cautions and the historical-wrapper
layout difference. Two synthetic tests exercise those cautions.

**Next concrete verification**: obtain both the CD-image extraction
and the post-installation copies of `Rayman2.exe`, `RAYMAN2.ICD`
and `dplayerx.dll` from the **same edition**, record each file's
SHA-256 and size, and compare which stage actually contains valid
PE images before selecting any decryptor. Do not copy proprietary
binaries into this repository.

## Cross-check against the separate Rayman2Fix repository

The owner's separate `legluondunet/Rayman2Fix` source
[`docs/architecture.md`](https://github.com/legluondunet/Rayman2Fix/blob/main/docs/architecture.md)
records the expected SHA-256 of its **protected retail Rayman 2 EXE**
as `7927a106ac4f2244e304e57c196170f6cfb311af87ddf59eb6e6c48b9bb0d5e3`.
This matches our exact uploaded `Rayman2.exe` hash. A separate
SHA-256-pinned *unprotected* executable is used for actual launch by
Rayman2Fix. Thus, this sample's protected-EXE identity is
**corroborated by the owner's own independent project**, even though
the provenance of its paired ICD/DLL still requires verification.

The Rayman2Fix CD extraction documentation explicitly warns that
**raw ISO extraction is not necessarily equivalent to installed game
files**, including possible transformation of content by the
original installer. The project's root-exclusion list includes a
file named **`dxplayerx.dll`**, whereas the uploaded research
sample is named **`dplayerx.dll`**. These two spellings differ
(the former has an additional `x` immediately after `d`).
We must **not silently equate them**: inspect the original CD file
listing and the actual installation receipt before deciding
whether the supplied 165,888-byte sample is the intended SafeDisc
auxiliary file. File extension and user-visible name alone are
insufficient provenance evidence.

The current evidence supports analyzing the known protected
`Rayman2.exe` as genuine. It does **not** support treating the
non-PE `RAYMAN2.ICD` and `dplayerx.dll` as directly loadable
Windows binaries, or asserting they are bad/corrupt without
checking the physical CD and installation stages.

## Reproducible original-CD vs original-installation comparison

A new cross-platform, standard-library-only, read-only helper,
[`scripts/compare_safedisc_stages.py`](../scripts/compare_safedisc_stages.py),
tests the most important unresolved hypothesis: **whether the original
installer transforms or substitutes the ICD and companion DLL**.

Keep separate directories containing (1) the files extracted from the
original CD and (2) the files copied from the **unmodified original
game installation**, before any Rayman2Fix patching. The directories
may be on Linux or Windows, and this diagnostic does not require
Wine, the game's EXE to be runnable, or a mounted CD at inspection time.

```sh
python scripts/compare_safedisc_stages.py \
  --cd-root "/path/to/original-CD-root" \
  --installed-root "/path/to/original-install-folder"
python -m unittest discover -s scripts -p 'test_compare_safedisc_stages.py'
```

The JSON output reports root-level `rayman2.exe`, `rayman2.icd`,
`dplayerx.dll`, and `dxplayerx.dll` **separately**. For each file,
the result is `identical`, `different`, `cd_only`,
`installed_only`, or `absent_both`, with any present file's actual
name, size and SHA-256. An `alias_discrepancy`-style flag highlights
the distinct DLL spellings, **without treating them as interchangeable**.
No original files or proprietary data are copied into the repository
or changed. Nine synthetic local regression tests pass.

**Interpretation constraints:**

- Two matching SHA-256 hashes establish equality between the *two
  user-supplied roots*, not that either root is a genuine CD copy.
- Missing original-install files may be installer-only media auxiliaries:
  they are not automatically corrupt.
- A `different` result establishes a transformation or version
  mismatch, but does not reveal how it occurred.
- This tool checks only the specified root directories; it does not
  recursively inspect a disc/installation or reconstruct the original
  installer. Directory contents should first be obtained from the
  owner's authentic, same-edition installation.

### Primary-source version clue

A [2002 SafeDisc FAQ by a Wine developer]
(https://www.winehq.org/pipermail/wine-devel/2002-April/005861.html)
explicitly identifies **165,888-byte `dplayerx.dll` as SafeDisc 1.35.0**,
the exact size of the owner-supplied Rayman 2 companion file. This is
**strong independent support for the 1.35 classification**, alongside
the Wine Rayman 2 bug report. It does not by itself confirm that
this particular opaque file is a correct *installed* DLL or recover
any decryption keys.

### Random-stream hypotheses excluded (limited checks)

For both 31-bit word streams (big-endian ICD and little-endian DLL),
read-only numerical tests found no support for:

- The classic **glibc `random()` additive recurrence** with lags
  3 and 31 (output (x_i) must equal the two lagged outputs plus
  a 0-or-1 carry modulo (2^{31})); first 15,000 eligible values
  fail immediately in both files.
- A single affine recurrence `x[n+1] = a*x[n]+c (mod 2^31)`
  throughout the stream. The first three words may suggest a
  candidate when a difference is odd, but it does not reproduce
  subsequent values; a simple LCG is not established.

These *negative controls* only reject those specific generator
models; they do not show the content is encrypted, random, or fake.
The observed 31-bit constraint, ordinary PE absence and unanswered
file provenance are still the principal research evidence.

## Next research milestones

1. Identify and document the protected loader's format and the specific
   SafeDisc version using reproducible evidence, with no execution of
   unknown binaries or protected DLL code in the inspector.
2. Map the encrypted/compressed container boundaries and decode transforms
   from primary evidence, rather than reusing unverified title-specific
   Crimson Skies offsets and keys.
3. Reconstruct PE sections, imports, entry points and metadata and validate
   independently against legitimate user-owned references where available.
4. Keep the existing Crimson Skies hashes and output checks intact; test
   Windows and Wine gameplay only after a sound reconstruction is produced.

**No generic SafeDisc 1.35 decryption is claimed at this stage.**
