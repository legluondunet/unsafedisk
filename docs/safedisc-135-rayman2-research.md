# Rayman 2 retail CD — SafeDisc 1.35 research

Status: **read-only classification implemented; native unwrapping not implemented.**

The user reports that [Redump disc 47594](https://redump.org/disc/47594/)
identifies this disc as SafeDisc **1.35.000**. This is a hypothesis to validate
against the protected loader and the specific uploaded files; the tool does
not infer a SafeDisc version from a filename, file size, or entropy.

## Owner-supplied inputs, identified by SHA-256 only

| Role | Original name | Size (bytes) | SHA-256 |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Loader | Rayman2.exe | 676,352 | `7927a106ac4f2244e304e57c196170f6cfb311af87ddf59eb6e6c48b9bb0d5e3` |
| Protected data | RAYMAN2.ICD | 683,565 | `4daeae51ded23687fccecd5046dd366b1c083d4931af0a381a0ad0b64bd3d1a6` |
| Companion | dplayerx.dll | 165,888 | `0d5160b1b123636e03a09ae00714f0ff66bbdd759a3f2b639734ecaa487018ee` |

The second uploaded set was byte-identical to the first set. No game
binary, ICD, DLL or decoded output is committed to this repository.

## Read-only inspection

```sh
cargo run --bin unsafedisc-linux -- inspect --generic-inspect \
  --loader Rayman2.exe --icd RAYMAN2.ICD --dplayerx dplayerx.dll \
  --layout --sections
```

Expected properties from the sample (not exhaustive):

- The loader has a valid PE32 x86 header, entry RVA `0x0005FCC0`,
  and three sections.
- The ICD and companion DLL lack an `MZ` prefix and therefore are
  **opaque on-disk input**, not valid PE32 files at offset zero.
- The ICD and DLL have measured Shannon entropies of approximately
  **7.9539** and **7.9525 bits/byte**. High entropy is *not proof* of
  encryption, compression, SafeDisc identity or decryptability.
- A successful generic inspection is a metadata report only. It cannot
  create an EXE or validate gameplay.

The original `inspect --generic-inspect` stopped on these inputs with
`not an MZ executable`. This branch handles opaque files as research
inputs while preserving the existing exact-hash restrictions and
fail-closed behavior in `unwrap` and strict `inspect`.

## Independent static profile of these inputs (2026-11-12)

The following observations were obtained on the original user-supplied files
without loading or executing them (Python standard library, `file`,
`objdump -x`, `objdump -d`).

| Property | `Rayman2.exe` |
|---|---|
| DOS/NT headers | `MZ` at file offset `0x0`; `PE\\0\\0` at `0xB8` |
| PE machine / format | i386 / PE32, GUI |
| Image base | `0x00400000` |
| Entry-point RVA | `0x0005FCC0` |
| Reported PE timestamp | 1999-10-15 23:19:39 UTC (header value; not provenance proof) |
| Sections | `.text`, `.rdata`, `.data` |
| Import DLLs | `USER32.dll`, `GDI32.dll`, `WINMM.dll`, `MSVCRT.dll`, `KERNEL32.dll`, `SHELL32.dll`, `DINPUT.dll` |
| Export directory | Claims `MainWinf.exe`, 110 exported ordinals |
| `CRPE\\0\\0` signature | Not found in this loader |
| `DPLAYERX` plaintext string | Not found in this loader |

The `CRPE` marker used in the *separate* Crimson Skies SafeDisc 1.50.20
research is therefore **not portable as an assumed key-lookup location**.
No hard-coded replacement offset should be invented for 1.35.

The `MZ` and `PE\\0\\0` byte patterns also appear inside the executable
`.text` as x86 instruction operands in code which appears to validate
mapped PE headers and inspect `KERNEL32`. These matches are **not**
additional embedded PE images. This routine is a candidate for further
static cross-reference analysis, not proof of a particular SafeDisc stage.

Measured per-file whole-byte Shannon entropy:

| File | Entropy (bits/byte) | First 16 bytes |
|---|---:|---|
| `Rayman2.exe` | 6.627897 | `4D 5A 90 00 03 00 00 00 04 00 00 00 FF FF 00 00` |
| `RAYMAN2.ICD` | 7.953942 | `5B 8A C0 E4 6E BF 24 2F 01 6C CE B5 6A 5A B0 3A` |
| `dplayerx.dll` | 7.952524 | `EC FB 30 00 46 7C B8 0A 0D CC 7E 5C 7E 65 90 5F` |

For equal-length 4 KiB blocks (discarding the final incomplete block),
the entropy profiles are:

| Opaque file | Full 4 KiB blocks | Min. block entropy | Max. block entropy |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `RAYMAN2.ICD` | 166 | 7.893266 | 7.927141 |
| `dplayerx.dll` | 40 | 7.894593 | 7.917976 |

No low-entropy 4 KiB region stands out in either file. This does
**not** distinguish encryption from compression or establish cipher
boundaries. The new `--generic-inspect --layout` report prints this
profile for any sufficiently large input.

The ICD is `0xA6E2D` bytes long (not a round PE alignment size),
and the opaque DLL is `0x28800` bytes long. Neither begins with `MZ`
or contains a `PE\\0\\0` signature. A plain `dplayerx.dll` import
is **not present in the static import table** of the loader; this
does not rule out dynamic loading.

**Important:** `Rayman2.exe` has an extensive, genuine PE code,
import and export structure; describing it as “only an encrypted stub”
would go beyond these findings. Its actual protected launch sequence
must be traced before planning a decoder.

### Candidate protected-loader cross-reference (unconfirmed)

At image VA `0x00447C0C`, the executable compares an in-memory DOS
signature to `0x5A4D` (`MZ`), and at `0x00447C18` compares the PE
signature to `0x00004550` (`PE\\0\\0`). It then tests bytes
matching `KERNEL32.DLL` (case folding). At `0x00447D47`, a nearby
routine reads `FS:[0x30]` (Windows process environment block).
These locations are **research leads only**, and may belong to game
runtime code rather than SafeDisc. No key or protected payload boundary
is derived from them.

### Reproducibility

On a system with GNU binutils:

```sh
sha256sum Rayman2.exe RAYMAN2.ICD dplayerx.dll
file Rayman2.exe RAYMAN2.ICD dplayerx.dll
objdump -x Rayman2.exe
objdump -d -M intel --start-address=0x447BE0 --stop-address=0x447E20 Rayman2.exe
```

`objdump` emits the executable's image-base addresses rather than
raw file offsets. The `--start-address` range above is for preliminary
static code inspection, not an exploit or validated key schedule.

## Additional validation: accidental signatures are not PE files

A bounded read-only scan was performed on each owner-supplied input. Every
`MZ` sequence was checked as a possible start of a **structurally valid
x86 PE32** with a DOS header pointer, PE signature, bounded optional header
and section table. Merely counting `MZ` in high-entropy bytes is misleading.

| File | `MZ` occurrences anywhere | Structurally valid PE32 candidates | Candidate offsets |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `Rayman2.exe` | 2 | 1 | `0x0` |
| `RAYMAN2.ICD` | 16 | 0 | none |
| `dplayerx.dll` | 4 | 0 | none |

The extra `MZ` match in the EXE occurs within executable instructions, not
a second embedded image. None of the 20 `MZ` matches in the opaque inputs
passes PE32 structural checks. This is **not** evidence that decrypted PE
code is absent; the expected protected ICD is not meant to be a plain PE.

The generic Rust inspector now displays these two distinct counts with
`--layout`. It also **rejects a corrupt/non-PE loader** instead of silently
calling it an opaque successful inspection; only ICD and companion DLL
inputs are allowed to lack a PE header. These are read-only diagnostics
with synthetic tests; compilation and execution of the new Rust code
remain pending.

## Historical variant clue from original SafeDisc documentation

[CD Media World, *SafeDisc protection/version reference*]
(https://www.cdmediaworld.com/hardware/cdrom/cd_protections_safedisc.shtml)
catalogues a **165,888-byte `DPLAYERX.DLL`** as an early **r2**
family and **138,752 bytes** as a later **r4** family. Our Rayman 2
sample is 165,888 bytes while the previously validated Crimson Skies
sample is 138,752 bytes. This suggests **different protection families**
and a reason not to reuse the Crimson-specific loader/DLL assumptions.

This is a historical third-party classification based on **DLL size**,
not authenticated version metadata: it does **not** independently verify
SafeDisc `1.35.000` or prove that all files of equal size share a
decryption algorithm. The observed file size should be stored as
descriptive data, **not** used as an authorization to decrypt.

In particular, the Rayman 2 EXE contains a normal PE32 import table,
a `MainWinf.exe` export-name field with 110 exported ordinals, and
game-related strings (including `Please insert the CD`). Its entry
RVA `0x5FCC0` begins with what looks like C runtime initialization
rather than an obviously isolated SafeDisc entry stub. This is
important counterevidence against treating the entire EXE as a
recognizable dedicated SafeDisc loader without further trace analysis.
The relationship between this PE and the encrypted ICD is **not yet
established**.

## Next research milestones

1. Identify and document the protected loader's format and the specific
   SafeDisc version using reproducible evidence, with no execution of
   unknown binaries or protected DLL code in the inspector.
2. Map the encrypted/compressed container boundaries and decode transforms
   from primary evidence, rather than reusing unverified title-specific
   Crimson Skies offsets and keys.
3. Reconstruct PE sections, imports, entry points and metadata and validate
   independently against legitimate user-owned references where available.
4. Keep the existing Crimson Skies hashes and output checks intact; test
   Windows and Wine gameplay only after a sound reconstruction is produced.

**No generic SafeDisc 1.35 decryption is claimed at this stage.**
